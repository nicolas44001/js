	<h1> <em>JavaScript</em> </h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	

	<p>A programming language is a language used to formulate algorithms and produce computer programs that apply these algorithms. </p>
		<p>It is therefore a communication code, allowing a human being to communicate with a machine by submitting instructions and analyzing the material data provided by the system, usually a computer.</p>
		<p>A programming language is composed of different elements, syntax rules, vocabulary, semantics, alphabet, comments, identifiers.</p>
		<p>There are documentations regrouping all this for the languages here is an example for <em>Javascript</em>: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">here.</a> </p> 
		<p>We write the code on a compiler such as Atom, visual studio code or sublime text to name just a few.</p>

		<p>Generally we use a framework, which can be defined as a set of tools and libraries designed to improve your productivity. The idea is to give you access to preconceived codes that you can reuse for the development of a site, a mobile application, a game, an extension, etc.
		For <em>JavaScript</em> there are some such as AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, etc.</p>
		
		<p>There are different types of programming language such as <em>Javascript</em>, Python, Ruby, Java, C++ etc.</p>
		
		<p><em>JavaScript</em> (or JS), invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich, is an object-oriented programming language mainly used in web pages, especially for animations (pop-up windows or Psychedelic effect are <em>JavaScript</em>)</p>
	
	<h2>The Openclassrooms course: </h2>
	<p>As in all development courses, we start by writing "Hello World", with console.log(" Hello World "). It is a simple program to implement and understand, but I think it gives a direct perspective on what we will be able to achieve.</p>
	<p>Then we learn some vocabulary, what a number is, a string ("Hello World" is a string because there are quotation marks) and how to do an operation. </p>
	<p>Quotation marks are very important "5" + "1" will give 51 while 5+1 will give 6.</p>
	<p>In this first course we also learn to write a comment (// or /*...*/). Comments are very important, they are used to describe and document the code so that another person or even the developer can easily understand it.</p>
	<p>In the second part we learn what a variable is. Its name allows to identify it, its value, is the data currently stored in this variable, its type, determines the role and operations applicable to this variable. We learn how to declare it (create it) and how to assign a value to it. For example, I declare 2 variables:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The first "a" to which I assign 5 so a = 5</li>
		<li>The second "b" to which I assign 1 so b = 1.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So if I do console.log(a+b) I get 51.</p>
	<p>If I wanted to have 6 I would have had to do: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>a = Number(" 5 ")
		</li>
		<li>b = 1</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As I said, <em>JavaScript</em> is used for pop-up windows, you can easily create one with Alert and ask for the person's name with a prompt. This allows you to have a personalized announcement.</p>
	
	<p>To write the variable names there are 2 conventions, snakecase (example : variable_name) or camelCase (example : variableName). You have to choose one and not change it. In the Openclassrooms course we use camelCase. Then to organize the code we will use indentation.</p>
	<h3>Conditions with if: </h3>
	<p>A condition is either true or false. This is called Boolean. We will use the conditions for the execution of a variable.</p>
	<p>Openclassrooms takes a very simple example: </p>
	<p>The user must enter a number, if the number is greater than 0 then the message "the number is positive" appears.</p>
	<p>You can use else to create an alternative so if the number is less than 0 then the message "the number is negative or zero".</p>
	<p>We can add an if condition in the else to have several different options so if we take our example again: if the number is greater than 0, the message "the number is positive" appears otherwise if the number is less than 0 then the message "the number is negative" appears otherwise the message "the number is zero" appears.</p>
	<p>There are different logical operators, “and», «or"," no" that allow you to set conditions without using the if.</p>
	<h3>Repeat instructions: the loops</h3>
	<p>The "While" loop: as long as the loop is still true then it continues to turn. If it becomes false, we move on to the next part of the program. Often used with a counter. As long as the loop has not reached a certain number it continues to rotate.</p>
	
	<h3>The functions:</h3>
	<p>A function is a grouping of instructions that performs a given task. This helps to clarify the code to make it more readable by grouping different steps into different functions.</p>
	<p>You can call a function (execution of instructions) as many times as you want, so you don't have to copy the code every time and you can call a function in a function (<strong>don't overuse it!</strong>).</p>
	<p>Conditions or loops can be put in a function. The name of a function is written in camelCase. </p>
	<p>In <em>JavaScript</em> there are predefined functions such as prompt(), alert(), ...</p>
	
	<h3>An Object:</h3>
	<p>A JavaScript object consists of a set of properties. A property is an association between a name and a value. When its value is a function, we say that the property is a method of the object.</p>
	<p>We will therefore store information in the objects and we can declare functions there.</p>
	<h3>The arrays:</h3>
	<p>Arrays are used to store a large amount of information. For example, in a CRM, it will be possible to store the name, first name, email address, phone number, etc. This makes it possible to have an orderly and clear list. Of course, it is very easy to add or delete information. You can take (or call) the information from a table to put it in another code or in an email. Companies will therefore be able to easily make personalized emails with "Bonjour nicolas".</p>
	<h3>Now let's go back to the strings: </h3>
	<p>As a reminder, a string is a text placed between quotation marks. Strings as well as objects have properties and methods. We can know the size of a string, transform it into upper or lower case, compare it to another string, search within a string or transform it into an array.</p>
	
	<h3>Go further than openclassrooms: </h3>
	<p>The openclassrooms course which is in French which is not insignificant to start with because most of the other courses that can be found will be in English. This is a good introduction to web development and here to JavaScript. It allows you to test the code as the course progresses. It defines terms using simple and concrete examples. </br>

	<h3>What this course has brought me: </h3>
	<p>This summer I did a training from July to mid-September in web development with The Hacking Project which offers peer and remote learning courses with 2 projects to be delivered every week. I learned HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL. </br>
		The openclassrooms course was for me a revision of the introduction to <em>JavaScript</em>.</p>
